## Description
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles users’ financial information.

The goal of this app was to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user can add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total will be updated when they're brought back online.
